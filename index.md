# Jekyll Hours Template

<a href="hours.html">Current Hours: <span id="hours_display"></span></a>

`jekyll-hours-template` is a basic template to add daily hours and an hours page to your Jekyll site based on a YAML configuration file.
For example your organization has different winter and summer hours, as well as some special hours and closures --> you want to display the current day's open hours on every page in your site, plus have a "Hours" page with a summary of all the information.
(e.g. the demo "Current Hours" displayed above and the [demo Hours page](hours.html))

One YAML file contains all your hours info, and is used to generate JS, JSON, or content to be used on your Jekyll site.

The template has no styles as the parts are designed to be plugged into your Jekyll site.
